**Release log on version 1.0**

NEW
> Using image processing  to automatically determine the surface coverage (how much surface area (in %)) 
is covered by the DPP molecules. 

> To strengthen results, mitigate over all pictures provided for each test case (percentage, deposition time) 
and create error bars (median, mean, standard deviation) for each “measurements”. 

> The application automatically adds the calculating algorithm and plot resulting data in a joint graph, 
showing surface coverage [%] over deposition time.

> Current version supports on Avrami equation specifically used for the wafer ncubation that describes how solids 
transform from one phase to another at constant temperature.

> In the canvas, the adjust parameter is not yet supported or added that the user might need to fit the image size of 
512*512 accurately but the application also sclaes on the uploaded image.

> Group selection of images will be added in v.1.1
